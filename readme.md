**Project Date:** June 30, 2025
**Author:** Ibukunoluwa Fodunrin

## **Executive Summary**

This report details the findings from an exploratory data analysis of **15,678 sales orders** from `2021-01-01` to `2023-08-05`. The goal was to uncover key trends in sales, customer behavior, and operational efficiency to provide data-driven recommendations for strategic growth.

Our analysis revealed several critical insights:
* **Strong Sales Core:** A small number of products and customers are responsible for a significant portion of our revenue.
* **Ineffective Discount Strategy:** Current discounts show a negligible correlation with sales volume, suggesting a need to re-evaluate our promotional tactics.
* **Data Integrity Gaps:** Incomplete data for sales representatives and customer locations limits our ability to perform a full performance analysis and identify regional opportunities.

This document outlines these findings in detail and proposes actionable recommendations to enhance sales strategies, improve operational efficiency, and strengthen data governance.

2.  **Re-evaluate Discount Strategy:**
    * **Action:** Pause the current broad-based discount program.
    * **Action:** Design A/B tests for targeted promotions (e.g., volume discounts, bundled offers) on specific products or for specific customer segments to find what truly drives purchasing behavior.

3.  **Improve Data Collection & Governance:**
    * **Action:** Enforce mandatory data entry for the `sales_reps` and `location` fields at the point of order creation.
    * **Action:** This is a critical fix to enable accurate performance tracking, commission calculations, and targeted regional marketing.
